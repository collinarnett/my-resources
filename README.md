One of the best resources on the internet for visualized learning. These are some of my favorite channels for learning new things and keeping my self immersed in emerging technologies and ideas.
* [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/user/teksyndicate/featured) - A group of computer scientists who make cool projects, review hardware and host a weekly news segment.
* [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) - A channel about anything and everything computers. Very interesting videos regarding computer theory.
* [Thunderf00t](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmb8hO2ilV9vRa8cilis88A) - A PhD Physicist dedicated to educating the public on the importance of the scientific method and critical thinking. My summary doesn't do him justice, but his channel includes some awesome experiments and thoughtful videos on religion and recent events.
* [potholder54](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljE1ODdSF7LS9xx9eWq0GQ) - A channel similar to Thunderf00t; however potholder54 goes to great lengths to disprove ideas that rely on false information. He also has a wonderful playlist on the history of the universe.
