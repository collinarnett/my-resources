## [↑](#-youtube) Youtube
One of the best resources on the internet for visualized learning. These are some of my favorite channels for learning new things and keeping my self immersed in emerging technologies and ideas.

* [Level1Techs](https://www.youtube.com/user/teksyndicate/featured) - A group of computer scientists who make cool projects, review hardware and host a weekly news segment.
* [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) - A channel about anything and everything computers. Very interesting videos regarding computer theory.
* [Thunderf00t](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmb8hO2ilV9vRa8cilis88A) - A PhD Physicist dedicated to educating the public on the importance of the scientific method and critical thinking. My summary doesn't do him justice, but his channel includes some awesome experiments and thoughtful videos on religion and recent events.
* [potholder54](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljE1ODdSF7LS9xx9eWq0GQ) - A channel similar to Thunderf00t; however potholder54 goes to great lengths to disprove ideas that rely on false information. He also has a wonderful playlist on the history of the universe.
* [Ave(Arduinoversusevil)](https://www.youtube.com/user/arduinoversusevil/featured) - A dude who makes cool projects on his lathe, who also tears down random hardware and does so with a great Canadian sense of humor.

* [Essential Craftsman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzr30osBdTmuFUS8IfXtXmg) - Tips for building projects, maintaining a good work ethic and other essential life skills.
* [Janbrils](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQALLeQPoZdZC4JNUboVEUg/featured) - Jabrils makes software prototypes and codes live on twitch. I like his videos due to their relaxed but informative tone.

## [↑](#-books) Books
A collection of the books that I have read that have helped me in life and my career.

* [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) - A book dedicated to informing the public of the dangers that government surveilance and totalitarianism pose. Incredibly eye opening read from the perspective of a citizen in a society where only your thoughts are safe from persecution.
